#ðŸ“¦**SQL Data Warehouse Project** #

This project involves building a data warehouse using PostgreSQL, focusing on ETL processes, data modeling (bronze/silver layers), and transformations.

It is based on the YouTube tutorial by Data with Baraa, with custom enhancements and adaptations for usage in PostgreSQL instead of SQL Server.
